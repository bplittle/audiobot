# audiobot
slack bot that responds with soundcloud links so that they embed in the window

Used this tutorial as foundation:
https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-slack-bot-with-node-js-and-chuck-norris-super-powers#slack-real-time-apis

Need to add Slack Bot token to `bin/bot.js` or process.env as BOT_TOKEN.

Goal would be to use Soundcloud API (or something similar) to be able to query a full sound database that can embed in Slack.
